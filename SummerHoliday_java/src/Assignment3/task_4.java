	/*Write a program that determines the change to be dispensed from a vending
machine. An item in the machine can cost between 25 cents and 1 dollar, in 5-cent
increments (25, 30, 35, . . . , 90, 95, or 100), and the machine accepts only a single
dollar bill to pay for the item.
Input: 
Enter price in cents: 95â†µ
Output:
Your change is 0 quarters, 0 dimes, and 1 nickels.
Remember:
1 quarter = 25 cents.
1 dimes = 10 cents.
1 nickels  = 5 cents.
you will need to use assignment and shor hand operators for this task. Good luck (edited)
